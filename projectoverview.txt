Project Overview:
For my final mini project, I made a small interactive page called the Mood Art Generator. The idea is pretty simple. The user picks a mood, and the page uses that mood to change the colors, show a message, and generate a few floating shapes. I wanted something creative without being overly complicated, and this felt like a good way to use all the JavaScript parts we learned.

Why I Chose This Theme:
I picked this theme because I like the idea of using color and motion to show a feeling. It’s an easy concept to build on, and it gave me room to focus on the JavaScript instead of trying to design something huge.

Interactive Features:
- Mood dropdown for user input
- Button click event to generate the mood
- DOM changes for background color, messages, and shapes
- Hover titles on the shapes
- Click events on shapes that show a short message
- Random placement of elements to keep it fresh each time

Async Operation:
I used async and await to load a local JSON file (moods.json). This file stores the color, message, and extra info for each mood. The page fetches the data every time the user picks a mood.
